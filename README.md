## 🔐 Routing Strategy

* **Public Routes**: `/login`, `/register`, etc.

  * Guarded by `PublicRoute.jsx`
  * Redirects logged-in users away
* **Private Routes**: `/dashboard`, `/admin/*`, `/candidate/*`, etc.

  * Guarded by `PrivateRoute.jsx`
  * Requires valid session/user role

Example:

```jsx
<Route path="/admin" element={<PrivateRoute allowedRoles={['admin']} />}>
  <Route index element={<AdminDashboard />} />
</Route>
```

## 🛠 Technologies Used

| Tool/Library     | Purpose                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Vite             | Fast build tool and dev server    |
| React            | UI framework                      |
| Tailwind CSS     | Utility-first CSS framework       |
| React Router DOM | Routing and route guards          |
| Axios / Fetch    | API communication                 |
| NVM              | Node version management (Windows) |

## 🧠 Features to Implement

* ✅ Auth (Login/Register)
* ✅ Role-based routing
* ✅ Admin panel
* ✅ Candidate test pages
* ✅ Trainer dashboard
* ⏳ Result history and reporting
* ⏳ Live timer during assessments
* ⏳ Leaderboards / Scoring
* ⏳ Question banks (MCQ, subjective)

---

## 📌 Development Guidelines

* Use Tailwind for all styling (`index.css` includes Tailwind setup)
* Keep components modular and reusable
* API interactions should go through `utils/apiclient.js`
* Place layout files (e.g., `AdminLayout`, `AuthLayout`) under `Pages/` or a `Layouts/` folder if created

## 🙋 Need Help?

If you'd like help setting up backend integration, authentication logic, or you want prebuilt components like:

* Auth flow with JWT
* Full page layout (sidebar + header)
* Toast notifications
* Dynamic test renderer

Let me know — I can scaffold them instantly.

```

---

## ✅ What Next?

Let me know if you'd like me to generate:
- `App.jsx` with routing and layout
- `Sidebar` and `Header` code
- `PrivateRoute` / `PublicRoute` logic
- Dummy pages for Admin / Candidate / Trainer

I'll generate those with Tailwind-ready layouts.
